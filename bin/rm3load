expensive or cheap, it usually lives in the garage on rubber-coated \
hooks and gets pulled out on random sunny days and then forgotten \
about the rest of the time.  But then there\'s a small percentage of \
the population out there, which I\'m part of, that rides their bikes \
all the time, rain or shine, and gets real stuff done on their bikes, \
like commuting to work and buying groceries.  To do this safely \
requires a few pieces of electronic hardware.  Some people, like \
myself, ride a bit more than that.  And, at least for me, I\'ve found \
something really annoying in all of the biking gear I\'ve \
owned...</div>     </div>   </div> \
