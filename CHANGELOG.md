# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

This version is incompatible with 0.1.x and 0.2.x databases.  The upgrade path from 0.2.x databases is to dump using rm3backup to a directory that you load with rm3load and recreate the permissions  (You can manually edit `permissions.json` if necessary)

### Added
- More operational docs, explained some of the authentication pipeline.
- Ability to change the number of items per page.
- Ability to have hidden pages.
- Card view now has tags.
- State machine to control drafts / approvals / blob workflow.
- Checkbox when you edit a page to control if you want to edit the draft further or create a new draft.
- Index uses thumbnails for photos and vector graphics.
- Atom feeds are now available
- Adding ETags to responses for HTTP caching.
- Can configure the listening port with `RM3_LISTEN_PORT`
- Added `RM3_CACHE_CONTROL_DISABLE` to make things easier for dev work.
- Added the ability to configure sites and disable the login button.
- Tracking 'touched' time separately from the official 'modified' time.
- Full text search.
- Rate limit (tracked via Redis) to prevent brute-force on logins and comments.
- Can disable the search on the sidebar for child pages.
- Caching SQL requests in redis:
  - fetchMostRecentChange
  - fetchEffectivePermissions
- Caching the SQL query generation to cache the slow squel part (424 ops/s vs. 102 ops/s)
- Removing some unnecessary copypasta so that most common CRUD operations need one less file.
- Setting `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options` and disabling the `X-Powered-By` header.
- Checking for HTTPS when trying to log in (can be disabled with `RM3_DANGER_DISABLE_HTTPS_CHECKS`)
- Adding `RM3_DANGER_TRUST_PROXY` for use behind an nginx or apache or varnish or other such proxy.
- Added by default the `history` permission that controls if the user can see the history.
- Added image enrichment, to replace `img` tags with responsive images.
- Added `RM3_LISTEN_HOST` so you can only listen on the localhost.
- Added OpenGraph and Twitter Cards support.
- Added protos:
  - Link
  - Email form
  - Audio
- Added the ability to load history with rm3load
  - added --nohistory flag to smash history
  - breaks on 0.2.0 backups currently because it tries to assign a user to a permission once when it loads user history and once when it loads the credentials file.
- Inspects URLs passed by bookmarklet for OpenGraph and other information.
- Refactored permissions to have more fine-grained permissions.
- Made comments able to be held in a moderation state.
- Allowed the user to set the 'memo' field and not update the update time (For minor textual changes)
- Added a tree view page to browse all of the pages within a site.
- Added the ability to load a dump under a username.
- Added textblock to the photo / vectorgraphic / audio protos.

### Changed
- Upgraded to textblocks-0.14, removed support for pragma blocks entirely.
- Changed setting so that a session cookie isn't generated until needed.
- Removed `connect-flash` and replaced it with tiny middlware, because sessions were being generated when they shouldn't.
- Security router is split out from command router, now if you don't supply a security router, the page is default-deny.
- The index class isn't very temporary.
- Removed default require for babel, now only running babel when importing JSX.
- Cleaned up the setup for the view JSON and removed repeated ugly code.
- Security: Reduced a bunch of routes that weren't really routable after all.
- Security: Session cookies are now httpOnly.
- Refactored protos for less repeated code.
- Improved error display.  403, 404, 410, 429 pages all have rendered templates, disable stackdumps in production
- Abstracts are now HTML text and are sanitized before being inserted into the system.

### Fixed
- Search page doesn't cause errors when you don't pass it the right search.
- Some uninitialized variables in the forms.
- Increased the range of SVGs able to work by running svgo before domPurify.
- Twitter auth wasn't quite storing the right profile info.
- rm3load doesn't try to start a workflow worker, just the workflow system.
- Entity#clone() didn't really work the way I wanted it to.

### Removed
- node 0.12 support removed.
- postgres 9.3 support removed.  postgres 9.4 now recommended.

### Fixed
- Coverage collection fixed.
- Icon generation uses picture polyfill instead of accidentally invalid html.
- If a user provides an invalid cookie for user deserialization (e.g. trying to log in after clearing the databse but not the Redis session cache) the error is logged and the request continues as if the user is unauthenticated.

- RM3_SESSION_SECRET to store the session secret, instead of known hardcoded secret.
- A bunch of views weren't checking for read access.
- Password changing has been protected differently from editing a user profile.

## rm2

I started on Rm2 in early 2011, once I had a few too many aborted efforts into refactoring the questionable design decisions from 2004 and wanted some stuff to speed up my learning of how node.js worked.  There are several classes that exist solely as direct ports of the Ruby version of the object, but using JavaScript idioms instead.  Some of them got coppied over to rm3.

## rm

I started on Rm around October 2004.  It became functional at the start of 2005, but I went through various rewrites and distractions and didn't actually launch it until Oct 2007.  It's been running in production ever since.

Most of the basic concepts behind rm3 were born here.  Entities (I called them Nodes, but then decided it would be really confusing), Logs, a Query engine, Paths that map to PostgreSQL ltree types, RDF/JSON-LD styled triple-tags, and more.

Unfortunately, I didn't write any unit tests and kinda forgot all of the corner cases that I manually tested and decided I needed to start over.
