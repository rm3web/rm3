## [0.4.0] - Moderate - 2017-02-21: Would Have Done It Earlier But For A Two Hour Power Outage edition

**Note**: Many of the non-breaking changes for this milestone were rolled out already in 0.3.x builds, so if you are just joining us after the 0.3.0 release, check the added functionality in the point releases instead of just what happened between 0.3.8 and 0.4.

I'm able to replace all of my installations of the original rm with rm3 0.4.  It's still alpha but it should work for you. :)

**BREAKING**: There are database changes since 0.3.  Before you install 0.4 you should delete the workflow:
```sql
drop table wf_jobs;
drop table wf_jobs_info;
drop table wf_runners;
drop table wf_locked_targets;
drop table wf_workflows;
```

And then you can add the tables:
```sql
CREATE TABLE wh_geotag (
  "predPath" ltree,
  "objGeotag" point,
  "subjPath" ltree,
  "objClass" text
);

CREATE TABLE wh_ticket (
  PRIMARY KEY("ticketId"),
  "ticketId" uuid,
  path ltree,
  "inetAddr" inet,
  "identityId" uuid,
  "userPath" ltree,
  subject text,
  recorded timestamp,
  details json
);

CREATE TABLE wh_serviceaccount (
  PRIMARY KEY(provider, "clientId"),
  provider text,
  "clientId" text,
  "providerDetails" json
);

CREATE TABLE wh_workflowsub (
  PRIMARY KEY("subscriptionId"),
  "subscriptionId" uuid,
  proto text,
  pathQuery lquery,
  "actorPath" ltree,
  "workflowDetails" json
);
```
and create the workflow engine again:  `./bin/rm3admin createworkflow`

Alternatively, you can load from a saved dump.

### Added
- Image protection, so that full-resolution original images aren't part of a public blob store
- Unobtrusive watermarking
- rm3mv command
- rm3rm command has the -r option to redirect to an external URL.
- Ontological tag can be in template.
- Added support for ontological tags, tag categories, link tags, and auto-suggest tags.

- OAuth2 support
- DB table for workflow subscriptions (but no code yet)

### Changed

### Changed

- Can disable the basicindex pagination "more" link
- Page for the predicate proto now has a search and shows useful information.

### Fixed
- If you tried to load a page with an unsupported proto, the index code would crash.  Now it will vaguely work.

### Added

## [0.3.0] - Medium - 2016-9-24: Coming to you live and direct edition...

This version is the first I'm actually trying to run in production.

This version is incompatible with 0.1.x and 0.2.x databases.  The upgrade path from 0.2.x databases is to dump using rm3backup to a directory that you load with rm3load and recreate the permissions  (You can manually edit `permissions.json` if necessary).  You will also need to manually set hidden to false (use `update wh_entity set hidden=false;` in your SQL database)

### Added
- More operational docs, explained some of the authentication pipeline.
- Ability to change the number of items per page and select protos and child paths.
- BREAKING: Ability to have hidden pages.
- Card view now has tags.
- State machine to control drafts / approvals / blob workflow.
- Checkbox when you edit a page to control if you want to edit the draft further or create a new draft.
- Index uses thumbnails for photos and vector graphics.
- Atom feeds are now available
- Adding ETags to responses for HTTP caching.
- Can configure the listening port with `RM3_LISTEN_PORT`
- Added `RM3_CACHE_CONTROL_DISABLE` to make things easier for dev work.
- Added the ability to configure sites and disable the login button.
- Tracking 'touched' time separately from the official 'modified' time.
- Full text search.
- Rate limit (tracked via Redis) to prevent brute-force on logins and comments.
- Can disable the search on the sidebar for child pages.
- Caching SQL requests in redis:
  - fetchMostRecentChange
  - fetchEffectivePermissions
- Caching the SQL query generation to cache the slow squel part (424 ops/s vs. 102 ops/s)
- Removing some unnecessary copypasta so that most common CRUD operations need one less file.
- Setting `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options` and disabling the `X-Powered-By` header.
- Checking for HTTPS when trying to log in (can be disabled with `RM3_DANGER_DISABLE_HTTPS_CHECKS`)
- Adding `RM3_DANGER_TRUST_PROXY` for use behind an nginx or apache or varnish or other such proxy.
- Added by default the `history` permission that controls if the user can see the history.
- Added image enrichment, to replace `img` tags with responsive images.
- Added `RM3_LISTEN_HOST` so you can only listen on the localhost.
- Added OpenGraph and Twitter Cards support.
- Added protos:
  - Link
  - Email form
  - Audio
- Added the ability to load history with rm3load
  - added --nohistory flag to smash history
- Inspects URLs passed by bookmarklet for OpenGraph and other information.
- Refactored permissions to have more fine-grained permissions.
- Made comments able to be held in a moderation state.
- Allowed the user to set the 'memo' field and not update the update time (For minor textual changes)
- Added a tree view page to browse all of the pages within a site.
- Added the ability to load a dump under a username.
- Added textblock to the photo / vectorgraphic / audio protos.
- Backed off the default workflow poll rate, allow it to be set with by the `RM3_WF_RUN_INTERVAL` environment variable.

### Changed
- BREAKING: Upgraded to textblocks-0.14, removed support for pragma blocks entirely.
- Changed setting so that a session cookie isn't generated until needed.
- Removed `connect-flash` and replaced it with tiny middlware, because sessions were being generated when they shouldn't.
- Security router is split out from command router, now if you don't supply a security router, the page is default-deny.
- The index class isn't very temporary.
- Removed default require for babel, now only running babel when importing JSX.
- Cleaned up the setup for the view JSON and removed repeated ugly code.
- Security: Reduced a bunch of routes that weren't really routable after all.
- Security: Session cookies are now httpOnly.
- Refactored protos for less repeated code.
- Improved error display.  403, 404, 410, 429 pages all have rendered templates, disable stackdumps in production
- Abstracts are now HTML text and are sanitized before being inserted into the system.
- Improved formatting on comment permalink view.

## rm2

I started on Rm2 in early 2011, once I had a few too many aborted efforts into refactoring the questionable design decisions from 2004 and wanted some stuff to speed up my learning of how node.js worked.  There are several classes that exist solely as direct ports of the Ruby version of the object, but using JavaScript idioms instead.  Some of them got coppied over to rm3.

## rm

I started on Rm around October 2004.  It became functional at the start of 2005, but I went through various rewrites and distractions and didn't actually launch it until Oct 2007.  It's been running in production ever since.

Most of the basic concepts behind rm3 were born here.  Entities (I called them Nodes, but then decided it would be really confusing), Logs, a Query engine, Paths that map to PostgreSQL ltree types, RDF/JSON-LD styled triple-tags, and more.

Unfortunately, I didn't write any unit tests and kinda forgot all of the corner cases that I manually tested and decided I needed to start over.
