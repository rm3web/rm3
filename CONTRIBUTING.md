# How to Contribute

There are a wide variety of ways to contribute.  Documentation, bug triage, detailed issues (including UI/UX, bug reports, etc), artwork, schemes, and so on are all just as important as code.  Similarly, cleaning up the messy abstractions and copypasta, writing unit tests, and other non-feature tasks are probably more valuable to me.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms -- see [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md)

## Licensing

Rm3 is licensed under the GPL version 2.0 (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information). All contributors must agree to license their contributions according to those terms.

## Issues

rm3 uses the GitHub issue tracker.  Submitting issues requesting a change before trying to land a PR can be helpful, but isn't mandatory.  If you've got a major patch in mind, writing up a blueprint describing the feature, important functional points, and what some of the PRs would look like will make the process go more smoothly.

Please make an effort to not create duplicate issues.

Selected issues suitable for newcomers to the codebase will be marked with an "easy" tag.

## Pull Requests

 * You are not expected to smash multiple commits into a single commit.
 * PRs with code should pass the CI unit and integration tests, as well as lint.

## Review Process

 * Honesty is not the opposite of politeness.  Mind the Code of Conduct.
 * Unless you say otherwise, A "maintainer-fixes" style of merging is assumed, where any quibbles or minor necessary tweaks are done for you.  If you specify "maintainer-reviews", A list of identified things to change will be maintained for you to fix.  There's a checkbox in the GitHub UI where you can forbid maintainer edits.
