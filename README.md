What is it?
-----------

rm3 is not just a blog engine, but it's still lighter-weight and friendlier than those enterprise-grade CMS systems.  Conceptually, it is to Drupal as Ghost is to WordPress.

rm3 is able work as a blog, a wiki, a photo archive, or some combination of those... and more.

rm3 has blog-styled views such that you can post a series of dated blog articles and view them as such.  But every entity on the site has a history, like how a wiki works.  Like some of those enterprise CMS systems, you aren't restricted to just creating a mere list of posts.

rm3 has rapidly improving support for media:  It supports photos, but it also supports SVG vector graphics and audio files.  

Release Status
--------------

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.

This is currently in ALPHA state, defined as:
* I'm running it in production
* Key features are not missing
* Any data you put in here you should be prepared to reconstruct without the benefit of a migration tool (but I'm going to try very hard to avoid that)
* Security and stability bugs are to be expected.
* Some stable internal APIs will be present.

The next milestone is BETA, defined as:
* Key features are not missing
* Any data you put in here should be able to be migrated with an offline migration where you need to shut down the site momentarily
* Stability bugs are to be expected.
* Stable APIs will be present.

Contributing
------------

There are a wide variety of ways to contribute.  Documentation, bug triage, detailed issues (including UI/UX, bug reports, etc), test cases, refactoring, artwork, schemes, and so on are all just as important as features.

Sections of the code are kinda messy copypasta that I'm waiting for a good abstraction to refactor.  Patches to fix that are probably even more important than full features.
