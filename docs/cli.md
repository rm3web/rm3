CLI Tooling for rm3
===================

rm3 has CLI commands for operations that either ought to be automated at least some of the time or are too dangerous to have exposed on the web front-end because they might really break things.

Also, a few operations are only available via the CLI, in the absense of a bit more UI work.

All of the CLI tooling should be at least a little bit self-documenting.  Use the `--help` option to see all of the available options.

If you `npm install rm3` into a directory, these should be available in the ./node_modules/.bin/ directory.

**Warning: These operations ignore the permissions system entirely and may have dangerous consequences.**

rm3load
--------

Loads a single document from either a JSON file or stdin.

Example:

* Load default_frontpage.json `./bin/rm3load -f default_frontpage.json`
* Load page.json and change the path to `wh.blah` `./bin/rm3load -f page.json -p wh.blah`
* Load a backup stored in folder `backup`: `./bin/rm3load -d backup`

rm3dump
-------

Dumps a node to the console.

* Dump wh.users page to stdout `rm3dump wh.users`
* Dum wh page to stdout, with history, in a more readable format `./bin/rm3dump -lf wh`

rm3backup
---------

Fills a directory with a semantic backup.

`rm3backup backupdir` will copy the contents of the site into the directory `backupdir`.

In order to make sure that there aren't accidentally any excess files included in the backup, it requires an empty directory.

rm3rm
-----

rm3rm will delete entites from the site.

`rm3rm wh.the_meat` will delete an entity just like you'd expect if you deleted it via the web.

`rm3rm -E wh.the_meat` will forcibly delete everything about the entity.  It will be as if it never existed (although any blob files will remain).  This is a dangerous operation.

`rm3rm wh.the_meat -r http://www.example.com/` will delete an entity and place a redirect to an external site.

rm3mv
-----

rm3mv will move a node

`rm3rm wh.the_meat wh.meat` move an entity from the first path to the second path.

Warning: This won't move things that have blobs right now.

rm3admin
--------

rm3admin is the swiss-army chainsaw of the tooling, comprising all of the sophisticated admin tasks
